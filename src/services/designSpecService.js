# Design Specification Document
## ${projectName}

### Design Theme: ${designData.name}
${designData.description}

## 1. Design Philosophy & Vision

${description.philosophy}

### Visual Theme
${description.visualTheme}

### User Experience Goals
${description.userExperience}

## 2. Color System

The ${designData.name} theme uses a carefully curated color palette designed to ${designId === 'tech-dark' ? 'create dramatic contrast and visual impact' : 'maintain clarity and reduce visual noise'}.

### Primary Colors
${designData.colors && Object.keys(designData.colors).length > 0 ? 
  Object.entries(designData.colors).map(([key, color]) => {
    // Handle both object format and simple string format
    if (typeof color === 'object' && color !== null) {
      return `**${color.name || key}** (${color.hex || color.color || '#000000'}): ${color.description || 'Custom color from design analysis'}`;
    } else {
      return `**${key}** (${color}): Custom color from design analysis`;
    }
  }).join('\n') :
  'Colors will be defined based on your custom design analysis'
}

### Color Usage Guidelines
${designId === 'minimalistic' ? 
  `- Background colors should create subtle layers and depth
- Text colors maintain high contrast for readability
- Accent colors are used sparingly for calls-to-action and important highlights
- Borders and dividers provide structure without competing with content` :
  `- Deep blacks create infinite depth and premium feel
- Bright accents create dramatic focal points and guide attention
- Gradients add depth and visual interest to key elements
- Color combinations should maintain accessibility while maximizing impact`
}

---

## 3. Typography System

### Primary Typeface: ${designData.typography.primary}
${designId === 'minimalistic' ? 
  'Inter is chosen for its exceptional readability, modern character, and versatility across all interface elements. Its clean, neutral design ensures content clarity while maintaining personality.' :
  'Space Grotesk provides a distinctive, technical character that complements the high-tech aesthetic. Its geometric forms and modern letterforms create visual consistency with the theme.'
}

### Typography Hierarchy

#### Headings
- **H1 (Page Titles)**: ${designData.typography.headings.h1.size}, weight ${designData.typography.headings.h1.weight}, letter-spacing ${designData.typography.headings.h1.spacing}
  ${designId === 'minimalistic' ? 'Used for primary page titles and major sections. Should have generous spacing above and below.' : 'Creates dramatic impact for primary page titles with bold presence.'}

- **H2 (Section Headers)**: ${designData.typography.headings.h2.size}, weight ${designData.typography.headings.h2.weight}, letter-spacing ${designData.typography.headings.h2.spacing}
  ${designId === 'minimalistic' ? 'Used for main content sections and card titles.' : 'Maintains hierarchy while creating visual rhythm through the interface.'}

- **H3 (Subsections)**: ${designData.typography.headings.h3.size}, weight ${designData.typography.headings.h3.weight}, letter-spacing ${designData.typography.headings.h3.spacing}
  ${designId === 'minimalistic' ? 'Used for component titles and smaller sections.' : 'Provides clear content organization without overwhelming the primary hierarchy.'}

#### Body Text
- **Size**: ${designData.typography.body.size}
- **Weight**: ${designData.typography.body.weight}
- **Line Height**: ${designData.typography.body.lineHeight}

${designId === 'minimalistic' ? 
  'Body text prioritizes readability with generous line spacing and comfortable font size. The medium gray color reduces eye strain while maintaining sufficient contrast.' :
  'Body text maintains readability against dark backgrounds with carefully chosen contrast ratios and optimized spacing for extended reading sessions.'
}

## 4. Spacing & Layout System

### Base Grid System
- **Base Unit**: ${designData.spacing.baseUnit}
- **Section Spacing**: ${designData.spacing.sections}
- **Card Padding**: ${designData.spacing.cards}
- **Button Padding**: ${designData.spacing.buttons}

### Spacing Philosophy
${designId === 'minimalistic' ? 
  'Spacing is generous and purposeful, creating breathing room that allows content to stand out. The 8px base unit ensures consistent rhythm throughout the interface. Larger spacing between sections creates clear content hierarchy.' :
  'Spacing creates dramatic gaps and focused groupings. Larger base spacing accommodates glow effects and creates premium feel. Generous section spacing allows for immersive visual effects.'
}

### Layout Principles
${designId === 'minimalistic' ? 
  `- Content should never feel cramped or cluttered
- Use ample whitespace to create visual hierarchy
- Maintain consistent spacing patterns throughout the interface
- Group related elements with appropriate proximity` :
  `- Create dramatic spacing for visual impact
- Allow space for glow effects and gradients
- Use spacing to create depth and layering
- Maintain rhythm while allowing for visual effects`
}

## 5. Component Design Language

### Border Radius
**Standard Radius**: ${designData.components.borderRadius}
${designId === 'minimalistic' ? 
  'Subtle rounding creates friendly, approachable components without being overly playful. Consistent radius across all elements maintains visual harmony.' :
  'Generous rounding creates a modern, refined appearance that complements the high-tech aesthetic while maintaining usability.'
}

### Shadows & Effects
**Shadow Style**: ${designData.components.shadows}
${designId === 'minimalistic' ?

  'Glow effects and backdrop blur create dramatic depth and premium feel. Effects should enhance the high-tech aesthetic while maintaining usability.'
}

### Buttons
**Button Style**: ${designData.components.buttons}
${designId === 'minimalistic' ? 
  'Buttons have generous padding for easy interaction and clear visual hierarchy. Primary buttons use the accent color while secondary buttons maintain subtle styling.' :
  'Buttons feature gradient backgrounds and subtle glow effects. Interactive states should include color transitions and enhanced glow effects.'
}

### Cards & Containers
**Card Style**: ${designData.components.cards}
${designId === 'minimalistic' ? 
  'Cards create clear content boundaries with subtle borders and gentle shadows. Background remains clean white to maximize content contrast.' :
  'Cards feature floating appearance with backdrop blur effects. Dark surfaces with subtle borders create depth and premium feel.'
}
